Are researchers from lower ranking universities publishing with higher or 
lower APCs? In journals with higher or lower IF?

# OA with or without APC

Repeat figure from OA Who about university ranking and publishing types, but
this time with APC yes, no, and IF mean.


```r
apc_per_affiliation_per_sdg <- step1 %>% 
  mutate(APC = case_when(oa_status %in% c("hybrid") ~ "TRUE",
                         TRUE ~ APC)) %>%  
  group_by(affiliationid, SDG_label, year) %>% 
  count(APC, wt = frac_value)

# apc_per_affiliation_per_sdg %>% ungroup() %>% count(APC)

totals <- step1 %>% 
  group_by(affiliationid, SDG_label) %>% 
  summarise(n_frac_papers = sum(frac_value, na.rm = TRUE))

apc_per_affiliation_per_sdg <- apc_per_affiliation_per_sdg %>% 
  left_join(totals)
```

```
## Joining, by = c("affiliationid", "SDG_label")
```

```r
apc_per_affiliation_per_sdg_local <- apc_per_affiliation_per_sdg %>% 
  filter(n_frac_papers > 50) %>% 
  collect()
```







```r
apc_affiliation_leiden <- apc_per_affiliation_per_sdg_local %>%
  mutate(affiliationid = as.numeric(affiliationid)) %>% # needed for merging
  left_join(affil_leiden_key) %>%

  filter(!is.na(University), Period == "2015â€“2018")
```

Very interesting: really high universities publish less in DAOJ journals. Why is
that? which types of journals are these? This is especially true in medicine.
Maybe there is something specific going on here?

We can conclude:

- higher prestige institutions generally publish a larger share of their research
in OA journals that involve an APC

Next question: Is this also visible in terms of APC prices?
Then: how does this relate to IF?

And: is the APC (yes/no) divide also visible on regional level? Alternative 
explanation: lower ranked affiliations publish locally, and these local journals
might not have APCs. It still means: those researchers are not able to participate
in the high-ranking journal game.

Maybe correspondence analysis to relate these? IF in quartiles from SJR

What do we learn?

Inclusion criterion was for an institution to have at least 20 papers per last
author. in SDG 13 the lower ranked institutions do not have that.

In general, higher prestige is related to higher APCs. The effect is strongest 
for SDG 2, with a steep incline at the lowest ranking universities.
